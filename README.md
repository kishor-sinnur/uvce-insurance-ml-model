Medical Charge Prediction System for UVCE Insurance Company

Developed an automated system for UVCE Insurance Company to estimate annual medical expenditures for new customers based on factors like age, 
sex, BMI, children, smoking habits, and region of residence. This project utilized machine learning and linear regression techniques to predict medical charges, 
which assisted in determining the customerâ€™s annual insurance premium.

Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Plotly, Matplotlib
Data:Historical medical expenditure data of over 1300 customers from India.
Modeling:Built linear regression models to estimate charges, using features such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.
          Tuned model parameters to minimize prediction error (RMSE).
Feature Engineering: Managed categorical variables like region and smoking habits with one-hot encoding,
                    and normalized numerical features for improved model performance.
Evaluation: Assessed model accuracy using RMSE and explained feature importance to ensure transparency for regulatory compliance.
Visualization: Created detailed visual analyses using Plotly and Seaborn to illustrate relationships between customer features and medical charges, 
               facilitating stakeholder understanding of the model's predictions.
